# Whitepaper: Calculated Qist Protocol (CQP)
### Version 1.1 | February 2026

**Abstract:** The Calculated Qist Protocol (CQP) introduces a sovereign, post-quantum decentralized infrastructure designed to democratize AI compute resources. 

## 1. Governance & Sustainability Fees (10% Total)
A fixed percentage is allocated to the protocol's foundational pillars to ensure continuous growth:
* **Innovator Fee:** 2% (Conceptual and structural design).
* **Developer Fee:** 2% (Protocol engineering and maintenance).
* **Marketer Fee:** 2% (Ecosystem expansion and adoption).
* **Funder Fee:** 4% (Capital backing and liquidity support).

## 2. Resource Reward Pool (90% Total)
The majority of the minted value is directed to the physical resource providers:
* **Executor Payout:** 80% of the net pool (72% of the total minted value).
* **Overseer Payout:** 20% of the net pool (18% of the total minted value).

## 3. Consensus: Proof of Validated Work (PoVW)
CQP replaces speculative mining with verified utility through Checkpointed Sampling Verification (CSV).
