# Calculated Qist Protocol (CQP) 🌐
### Sovereign, Post-Quantum Infrastructure for Decentralized AI.

**CQP** is a Layer 0 protocol that transforms idle computing power into a global AI engine. It utilizes an **Executor-Overseer** model to ensure fairness, security, and computational integrity.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Network Sovereignty:** Fully independent blockchain architecture (Layer 0).
- **Post-Quantum Security:** Implements Lattice-based cryptography (Crystal-Dilithium) to resist future quantum attacks.
- **PoVW Consensus:** Proof of Validated Work ensures real-world utility and prevents resource waste.
- **Financial Transparency:** A strictly programmed 10% administrative fee and 90% resource reward structure.

## 💰 Economic Equity (Tokenomics)
CQP is built on "Calculated Equity." Every minted unit (QU) is distributed according to the sovereign code:
- **Stakeholder Fees (10%):** - 2% Innovator | 2% Developer | 2% Marketer | 4% Funder.
- **Resource Rewards (90%):** - 80% to Executors (High-power compute).
  - 20% to Overseers (Verification nodes).
