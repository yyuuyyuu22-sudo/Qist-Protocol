# Calculated Qist Protocol (CQP) 🌐
### Sovereign, Post-Quantum Infrastructure for Decentralized AI.

**CQP** is a Layer 0 protocol that turns idle computing power into a global AI engine. It separates **Executors** (High-power GPUs) from **Overseers** (Low-power validators) to ensure fairness, decentralization, and security.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Network Sovereignty:** Fully independent blockchain architecture.
- **Quantum-Resistant:** Lattice-based cryptography (Dilithium/Kyber).
- **PoVW Consensus:** Proof of Validated Work ensures real utility.
- **Fair Economy:** 80/20 reward split between workers and judges.
